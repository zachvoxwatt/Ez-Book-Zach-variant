  "content": "The Don said impatiently, \"For what? I didn’t answer before the wedding because on an important day like that there should be no cloud, not even in the distance. Also I wanted to know beforehand what he wanted to talk about. We know now. What he will propose is an infamita.\"\n\nHagen asked, “Then you will refuse?” When the Don nodded, Hagen said, “I think we should all discuss it—the whole Family—before you give your answer.\"\n\nThe Don smiled. \"You think so? Good, we will discuss it. When you come back from California. I want you to fly there tomorrow and settle this business for Johnny. See that movie pezzonovante. Tell Sollozzo I will see him when you get back from California. Is there anything else?\"\n\nHagen said formally, “The hospital called. Consigliere Abbandando is dying, he won’t last out the night. His family was told to come and wait.”\n\nHagen had filled the Consigliere’s post for the past year, ever since the cancer had imprisoned Genco Abbandando in his hospital bed. Now he waited to hear Don Corleone say the post was his permanently. The odds were against it. So high a position was traditionally given only to a man descended from two Italian parents. There had already been trouble about his temporary performance of the duties. Also, he was only thirty-five, not old enough, supposedly, to have acquired the necessary experience and cunning for a successful Consigliere.\n\nBut the Don gave him no encouragement. He asked, “When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?”\n\nHagen looked at his wristwatch. “In a few minutes they’ll cut the cake and then a half hour after that.” That reminded him of something else. “Your new son-in-law. Do we give him something important, inside the Family?”\n\nHe was surprised at the vehemence of the Don’s answer. “Never.” The Don hit the desk with the flat of his hand. “Never. Give him something to earn his living, a good living. But never let him know the Family’s business. Tell the others, Sonny, Fredo, Clemenza.”\n\nThe Don paused. “Instruct my sons, all three of them, that they will accompany me to the hospital to see poor Genco. I want them to pay their last respects. Tell Freddie to drive the big car and ask Johnny if he will come with us, as a special favor to me.” He saw Hagen look at him questioningly. “I want you to go to California tonight. You won’t have time to go see Genco. But don’t leave until I come back from the hospital and speak with you. Understood?”\n\n“Understood,” Hagen said. “What time should Fred have the car waiting?”\n\n“When the guests have left,” Don Corleone said. “Genco will wait for me.”\n\n“The Senator called,” Hagen said. “Apologizing for not coming personally but that you would understand. He probably means those two FBI men across the street taking down license numbers. But he sent his gift over by special messenger.”\n\nThe Don nodded. He did not think it necessary to mention that he himself had warned the Senator not to come. “Did he send a nice present?”\n\nHagen made a face of impressed approval that was very strangely Italian on his German-Irish features. “Antique silver, very valuable. The kids can sell it for a grand at least. The Senator spent a lot of time getting exactly the right thing. For those kind of people that’s more important than how much it costs.”\n\nDon Corleone did not hide his pleasure that so great a man as the Senator had shown him such respect. The Senator, like Luca Brasi, was one of the great stones in the Don’s power structure, and he too, with this gift, had resworn his loyalty."

  "content": "The Division - a classified unit of highly trained, self-supported tactical agents. They live ordinary lives, embed and hide their agent identity in society. They could be your acquaintance, your colleague, your friend or even your own family member. In the events of catastrophic disaster, institutional collapse and societal breakdown, they are activated and vow to restore the supposed order to communities and individuals suffering from disastrous times. In such harsh times, Division agents are trained to make the best out of the worst, use all of the abilities and possibilites they can use to uphold the mission.\n\nDivision agents are required to arm themselves with 6 pieces of gear, including a hazard protection repository mask, a high quality bullet proof armor vest, a noble side arm holster, an agile and flexibe backpack to store various of other equipments, a tactical gloves and a durable pair of kneepads. An agent always carries two 'skill' sets, which are highly - advanced gadgets that could provide an agent with lots of tactical advantages. 'Skills' exist in various forms and perform different functions; one of the skills can be mobile and explode right on the foot of their target; whilst another skill can provide medical aid to an agent if they are in need. 'Skills' are carefully researched, developed and manufactured by DARPA of the United States. Talking about gears of an agent is nothing without mentioning weapons. An agent can carry any type of weapon they could find. But this is more of personal preferences. In addition to the gears of an agent, a Division agent is known on hind sight by their Orange ring glowing smart watch and a relay device attached to elsewhere on their body, which also glows a ring of orange.\n\nThe technological infrastructure of the Division is fascinating. Most notably is their Intelligent Systems and Analytic Computer or as known as ISAC. ISAC is responsible for providing tactical, real time data and guidances to an agent. It also plays a role of an agent's partner so they will never feel alone and isolation on their duty.\n\nZach Freeman, one of the most skilled Division agents out there in the field, is being briefed for a covert operation. His assignment is taking down one of the Division's wanted targets and retrieving the stolen item from his Base of Operations, the Antiviral. It is said that small test tube look-a-like thing can be used to develop a cure to all diseases, including the disease that led to the activation of Division agents. Having heard that statement, the will of the agent arises, just like the Phoenix on his arm patch, and he determines to complete the mission. Little does he know, the covert operation will have changed his life forever.\n\nEarly morning, he presents himself at the starting point of the mission. The enemies are guarding around the area but they seem to be unaware of the agent presence. What is the other way to announce your arrival than tossing a grenade? \"Hint: There isn't\" - Zach said. He throws a grenade at a squad of enemies and it explodes shortly after. Shocked and stunned, they are alerted as the agent is advancing. He goes through all of the areas of their base and takes down any enemies standing on his way. Guns are blazing and explosives goes kaboom. Blood, sweats and bullet cases are spilled everywhere. In the end, only one person walks out of the warzone alive, with his trust worthy ballistic shield skill and an amphibious but quite helpful Firefly skill that blinds targets that he picks. As he has reached the final area where the target has nowhere else to run or hide, he immediately analyzes the area to find the most efficient way to neutralize all of the enemies. The execution of the plan goes flawlessly, all of the grunts are dead, only higher ranking enemies stand still. In the progress of moving from cover to cover, the agent is shot by one of the high ranking grunts. Luckily, it is only just enough to shatter his protective armor.\n\t\n- \"Protection system compromised. Plate integrity 0%. Needs immediate replacement\" - ISAC warns.\n\nThe agent nods, then proceed to remove the badly wrecked armor plate out of his protection vest and insert a new one into it.\n\t\n- \"Protection system restored. Plate integrity 100%\" - ISAC tells. \n\nAfter renewing his plate, the agent intends to strike back at the assailants, but he does not know that they have relocated back together to cast suppress fire at the agent. Acknowledging that, the agent deploys his ballistic shield and then leaves his cover place. The grunts gun down his shield but there is no use as the durability of the shield is too strong.\n\t\n- \"Ballistic shield taking damage. Shield integrity 87%\" - ISAC tells.\n\nThe grunts continue gunning down the agent's shield with everything they have. Suddenly, their firearm's are clicking with empty chambers.\n\t\n- \"SITH! I AM OUT!\" - One of the grunt shouted.\n\nHaving heard that the agent quickly gets his Blinder Firefly skill, aims it at the enemies to let ISAC register the targets and then throw the Firefly. Its tails burst out yellow flame making a nice looking trace line whilst it is flying. Upon reaching the targets, the Firefly then emits a flash brighter than most professional camera's flash at their eyes.\n\t\n- \"UGH! I AM BLINDED\" - They all shout and scream.\n\nWhen the grunts can barely see again, they can no longer find the agent's location. \"Target is lost! Find him!\" one of the grunts commands. Suddenly their is a cocking gun sound behind them. \"You don't have to look far...\" - The agent speaks slowly. Turns out, during the time they got blinded, the agent quickly relocated right behind them. Quite cheeky and sneaky move from a Division agent. Four distinct gunshots are fired and the four grunts with a hole in the head of each fall to the ground. The agent then deactivates his shield and picks up the Firefly for recharging it.\n\t\n- \"You guys are making this op too much easy. I wonder where is your boss at. I need to take something from her\" - The agent speaks with much confidence.\n\nSuddenly, a voice from the Intercom is heard. \"I am gonna remember killing you. It's been a while since I could say that to anyone\". Mila 'Wyvern' Radek mocks the agent\n\n- \"Target detected. Identified as Mila 'Wyvern' Radek. - ISAC informs the agent.\n- \"So, you finally decided to appear ey? After I murder all of your men? I was told that a leader should always fight side by side with their soldiers. It seems to me that you did not\" - The agent mocks back at Mila.\n- \"SHUT UP! YOU KILLED MY MEN, I'M GONNA TAKE YOURS!\" - Mila gets angry and proceeds to take out a grenade launcher.\n- \"Hmph! So be it!\" - The agent confirms.\n\nMila fires a grenade at the agent. It is a specialized grenade where it burst into flames upon impact. The agent quickly performs a side roll to dodge the projectile and fires his weapon at Mila. After having fired all of the ammunition of the weapon, Mila throws away the grenade launcher in anger and takes out her personal weapon. The gun fight occurs for more than 30 minutes with the agent and Mila are both excels at firearms, lots of bullet shells are distributed everywhere and grenades are thrown. Both characters are tired from the extended gunfight. \n\n- \"Haven't you given up? You could have just given me the Antiviral and then its done! Simple, isn't it? It does not have to go THIS way!\" - The agent talks to Mila.\n- \"Its done when I'm done with you. That is when you are dead\" - Mila yells at the Agent.\n\nWith the strength is pouring out soon because of the battle. The agent thinks to himself \"I must think and do something, extending a gun fight will never end well\". He suddenly remembers that his Firefly skill has been recharged fully, he analyzes the environment around him and non-stop questioning \"Beside the Firefly, what can I do? What can I use?\". He then spots a corpse of one of the grunts he killed earlier. A bright idea flashes through the agent's mind. He quickly relocates near the corpse, Mila detects him and opens fire. Bullets whizzes by the agent, he definitely can not peek up to see as it will be high chance he will get shot in the head. He holds the Firefly in hand and prays ISAC to find the target. \"I am counting on you, ISAC!\" - He says in his mind and then he throws the Firefly. Mila sees the Firefly and dodges its line of sight.\n\n- \"HA! You think your little toy can catch me? How hilarious!\" - Mila mocks the agent.\n- \"Crap!\" - The agent shouts.\n\nSuddenly, ISAC speaks\n\n- \"Enemy detected, rerouting Firefly to target\"\n\nThe Firefly turns 180 back at Mila. She seems to not paying attention to it until it comes close. \"Huh?\" - Confused Mila. The Firefly flashes right on her eyes and she is blinded.\n\n- \"FUCK!\" - Shouts Mila.\n- \"Now its my chance!\" - The agent thinks.\n\nAfter Mila gains some vision back, she angrily looks for the agent. \"WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?\" - she furiously yelling. Mila suddenly sees a moving silhouette near the wall. She grins and then empties her gun at the firearm, the silhouette seems to be lost balance and collapses to the ground. \"Well well, The Division isn't as tough as they look, are they?\" - Mila mocks the assumed dead agent. She then walks slowly to the corpse and checks. She discovers the corpse lying prone wears the clothes of the agent whom she has been fighting. She smirks faintly. Not long after that, she found that the corpse's trousers have similar color and pattern of the uniform she is wearing. She decides to turn the corpse over and is shocked after that. It is one of the 4 grunts whom the agent killed. As she realizes what is happening, a rifle's stock strikes her face from behind. The striker is no one else but the agent. He tricked Mila by using the time Mila got blinded, he takes off his shirt, then quickly puts it on the corpse and hides. Mila receives a quite heavy concussion from the agent.\n \nThe skies are as clear as crystals as the final battle between Mila 'Wyvern' Radek and Zach, the Division agent, has come to an end. \"God damn YOU!\" - mumbles Mila, Zach does not have to say anything because his eyes have already said it. \n\n- \"Its been a pleasure fighting you\".\n\nThen a gunshot echo breaks the silence, Mila lays motionless.\n\n- \"Target deceased\" - ISAC confirms for the agent.\n\nThe agent then holsters his weapon and enjoys the million dollar view. \"The antivirals are secured. We will make sure it gets extracted to safety. Send up a flare to signal the support team, Agent!\" - The director for the operation talks to the agent. \n\n- \"Did you say something agent? Our comms a.......re..........brea......k...........ingg....... up!..........Wha.......s........goig.......on......................................there!?........\"\n\nThe agent is confused as he does not say anything. \"Probably just bad connection I guess...\".\n\nJust as the agent is about to shoot up a flare, ISAC plays a warning sound and says \"WARNING! Unknown massive electromagnetic force spike in proximity\", the agent is confused :\"Huh?\". Winds and gusts around the agent start blowing like crazy. \"What is this!? What is going on?\" - the last thing the agent sees is a weird looking and eerie vortex slowly appearing right in front of him. It emits strong short bursts electric arcs which intensifies the horror that the agent experiences at the moment. The agent is shocked and caught off guard. He tries to make his way out of there, but there is no use, the vortex is too strong. He tries to grab and holds on to a solid object to prevent being sucked in.\n\n- \"HELPPPPPP!\" - The Agent shouts\n\nFor a minute straight, the vortex keeps growing stronger and the agent is running out of strength. Tiring from the battle and now this? How bad could it get?? As the agent has no strength left to hold on to his safety, he decides to let go and thinks \"I am gonna die...\". The errie vortex swallows the agent whole, the agent's scream slowly fading away. The vortex disappears right after and silence once again fills all over the place.\n\nSome minutes later, not having seen the flare which is supposed to be signaled by the agent, the Director talks to the agent \"Agent! We have not seen your flare for some minutes now, is everything OK?\" Radio silence... \"Agent! Are you still there?\" Radio silence again... \"Agent! Please response if you are there! How copy?\"\n\nNo response is heard for 5 minutes straight, The Director knows something is off. \"SITH!!\" The Operation Director angrily shout. \"Have a team deploy there immediately to look for the agent and the Antiviral! We got an MIA operator!\" - The director orders a squad commander. \"Where could you have gone agent?\" - questions the Director."
