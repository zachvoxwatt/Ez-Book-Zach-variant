<hr/>

I'm design a responsive book app UI using flutter, There is 3 page home page that includes a horizontal category list, then a list of recommended books, then a book detail view and a book content display with text settings. ~MrKafiri

The 3 pages left blank initially have been made more livelier by adding various functionalities like app settings, user's profile, app reminders and app's featured book screen. Heavily modified by ~Zach

> Package Used :
> - readmore
> - smooth_page_indicator

### How to commit it
1. `cd` your way to the repository folder
2. View the changes and differences by `git status` and/or `git diff`
3. Run `git commit -m <message>` with *message* as what you desire
4. Run `git branch -M <target branch>` IMPORTANT STEP!
5. Run `git push -uf origin <target branch>`
